# Beginning iPhone Development with Swift

My tour through iPhone dev using Swift and following the tutorials as set out in the book [Beginning iPhone Development with Swift](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-iPhone-Development-Swift-Exploring/dp/1484204107/ref=sr_1_1).

Each chapter walks through a (potentially new) application that builds on the fundamentals set out in the previous chapters.

## Chapter 1 - Hello, Swift

An overview of some of swift basics and iOS features/pitfalls.

## Chapter 2 - Hello, Xcode

A ridiculous sprint through Xcode, culminating in a simple iOS application that prints __"Hello, World!"__ to the screen.

## Chapter 3 - Button, button, who's got the button?

Basic user interaction using buttons and labels. Includes a brief tutorial on Actions and Outlets, the wiring blocks from the UI to the Controller.

## Chapter 4 - SO MANY CONTROLS

Don't ever do this at home (this chapter puts a slew of controls on the screen). Shows how to configure keyboard types and keyboard control release.

## Chapter 5 - Contraints, Points, and Pixels, OH MY

Constraints for multiple screen sizes, and how to evenly spread things across a screen.
